* 01 SafetyPlan_LaneAssistance

* 02 HazardAnalysisAndRiskAssessment

* 03 FunctionalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance

* 04 TechnicalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance

* 05 SoftwareRequirementsAndArchitecture_LaneAssistance.doc

throughout the project the functions considered do not correspond exactly to the one covered in the course:

- for the Lane Departure Warning:
	- the second safety function considered is a minimal torque threshold for the motion to be detectable by the driver.
